## Abstract
In edge computing environments, excessive data traffic between devices can lead to network bottlenecks, severely impacting overall network performance. To address this issue, Data Fragmentation Forwarding (DFF) techniques have been utilized to fragment data and distribute it across multiple links. However, traditional DFF methods often overlook the load on edge devices, resulting in constrained data transmission speeds.

This study introduces a Proportional-Fair Scheduling Data Fragmentation Forwarding (PFS-DFF) approach, which integrates the Proportional-Fair Scheduling (PFS) algorithm to account for the load conditions of edge devices, including link status and throughput. To evaluate the proposed method, we established a real-world edge computing setup using Raspberry Pi devices and a laptop under wireless conditions. We then conducted comparative analyses between PFS-DFF and other DFF methods in terms of data transmission performance.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PFS-DFF approach enables faster data reception even under high-load scenarios and maintains superior performance during large-scale data transfers.
